## changed class name to = "boxes" and was able to consoldate the css sheet to afect all the boxes class.

## changed div names to section names and the div to nav at the top of the page.

## worked through the css sheet to try and consoldate any redundenceys in the code i.e. grouping into the new cashback class I created and the new boxes class I rewrote.
